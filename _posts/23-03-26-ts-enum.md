# Enum
Enum is a type that allows you to give a member to a set of numeric or string values, which is useful if the type of value is set to a certain range.


```typescript
enum Month {
  January,
  February,
  March,
  April,
  May,
  June,
  July,
  August,
  September,
  October,
  November,
  December
}
```

```typescript
enum DayOfWeek {
  Monday = 1,
  Tuesday = 2,
  Wednesday = 3,
  Thursday = 4,
  Friday = 5,
  Saturday = 6,
  Sunday = 7
}
console.log(DayOfWeek.Monday) // 1
console.log(DayOfWeek.Tuesday) // 2
```


Thank you!
