In this post, it tells you about 'event-bubbling'.

# event-bubbling

Event bubbling is the one kind of phenomenon. 
If the handler assigned to an element operates when an event occurs,the parent element operating by the handler.
And this phenomenon repeats until the top parent element is operating.

Thanks.
