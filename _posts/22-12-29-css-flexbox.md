In this post, it tells you what is flex box. 

# flexbox 

It is one of the display properties of the CSS, which is effective in setting the layout, alignment, and spacing of containers.  
If user wants to use flex box, flex container has to have "display: flex;".

- flex container : parent element
- flex items : child element

```css
.flex_container {
  display: flex;
}
```

Also, the types of attributes available in flex containers and items are different.

- flex_container 
    - flex-direction
    - flex-wrap
    - justify-content
    - align-items
    - align-content
- flex_items
    - flex
    - flex-grow
    - flex-shrink
    - flex-basis
    -order

I'll cover more on the next page.
Thanks.
