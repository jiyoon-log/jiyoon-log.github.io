In this post, it shows how to fix the error about pic doesn't work.
It's just one way so there can be many other ways.

# reason (for me)

 - The extension of the image file is lowercase. 


[ErrorResult]

![ex_cake_lowercase](/assets/img/ex_cake_lowercase.jpg){: width="100" height="100"}

In the asset folder, its file name is like this.

[Reason]

![lowercase_ex](/assets/img/lowercase_ex.PNG)

So, I change the file's extension to capital letters.

[After]

![capital_ex](/assets/img/capital_ex.PNG)

And now, it shows the right result. 

[Result]

![ex_cake](/assets/img/ex_cake.JPG){: width="100" height="100"}


Thanks
