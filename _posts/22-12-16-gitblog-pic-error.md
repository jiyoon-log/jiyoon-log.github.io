In this post, it shows how to fix the error about pic doesn't work.
It's just one way so there can be many other ways.

# reason (for me)

 - The extension of the image file is lowercase. 

```
example.png
```

# Solution 

 - Make the extension of the image file into capital. 

```
example.PNG
```

Thanks
