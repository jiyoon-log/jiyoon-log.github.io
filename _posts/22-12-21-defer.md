In this post, it tells what is 'defer' property .

# defer

The defer property of the <script> 
tag specifies that the external script will run after the page is fully loaded.

This property is available only when the <script> 
element references an external script, 
so it is available only when the "src" property is specified.

# Syntax
```html
<script defer></script>
```

# Example
```html
<script src="/main.js" defer></script>
```

Thanks
