In this post, it shows the one solution of the error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined". 

This solution works for me. 

Error : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fill')

![ts-error-uncaught](/assets/img/ts-error-uncaught.PNG)

Solution (for me) : find typing error 

I hope you find your solution for your error.

Thank you!
