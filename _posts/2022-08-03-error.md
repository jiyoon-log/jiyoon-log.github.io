In this post, it shows the one solution of the error "The following destination is shared by multiple files." 

This solution works for me. 

Situation : Try to post the new posting.

Error : Conflict : the following destination is shared by multiple files. The written file may end up with unexpected contents

![conflict_0802](/assets/img/conflict_0802.png)

Solution (for me) : change the title (index) of the post file. 

The title (index) was used as the path. 

I hope you find your solution for your error.

Thank you!
